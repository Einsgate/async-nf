\section{Introduction}

In recent years, the research community has witnessed the quick development of
software-based middleboxes, due to the trend of network function virtualization
(NFV). NFV advocates moving hardware-based middleboxes away from critical
network paths and replaces them with software-based middleboxes running in
virtual machines or containers, to facilitate the deployment and provisioning of
important network services. That is to say, building high-performance software
middleboxes has become one of the core tasks for networking community.
